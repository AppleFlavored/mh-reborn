# Minehut Reborn
Minehut Reborn (MH:re) aims to make an extension that replaces the old
Minehut panel with a modern dashboard. The project is **highly experimental**
and any features can change at any moment.

While this is primarily a concept, MH:re is intended to be *mostly* 
functional. However, **MH:re does not plan on implementing functionality
dealing with payment.** This includes the marketplace, the sale of Minehut
credits, and similar features. You will need to use the official Minehut
panel if you plan on accessing those features.

## Contributing
At the moment, any pull requests will not be accepted, unless it includes
