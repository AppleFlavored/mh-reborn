# Minehut Reborn
Minehut Reborn is a browser extension that replaces the old Minehut panel with
a modern dashboard. The project is **highly experimental** and features can
change at any moment.

## Project Status
Minehut Reborn is currently **not** in active development. Most development is occurring
on a [standalone project](https://github.com/AppleFlavored/minehut-dashboard). In the future,
the work on Minehut Dashboard may merge with Minehut Reborn.
